        <p>
            In JS, "undefined" and "not defined" are both related to memory space and there is a simple difference between them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If the variable name which is being accessed doesn't exist in the memory space, then it is called not defined.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the variable name which is being accessed exists in the memory space but hasn't been assigned any value till now, then it is called undefined.
        </p>
        <p>
            To understand the concept of undefined and not defined JS variables through an example, check the console.
